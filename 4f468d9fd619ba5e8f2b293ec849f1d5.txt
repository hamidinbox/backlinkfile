    <p>Definition of writing – Writing, in English, has to be seen from two perspectives, writing as a process and writing as a product. As a process, writing is an activity of creating a readable text while as a product, writing is the created text.</p>
    <h2>My Writing Journey</h2>
    <p>I started my first blog, probably in 2007. That was the first time I interacted with computers and the Internet (on the discontinued Blogspot and Multiply). Due to the loss of the password, I did not continue to write my first blog. In 2009, when the Internet became better than before, I continued to blog. I wrote in a blog about WordPress. Year after year, I wrote at least four blogs intensively. I wrote articles about linguistics, technology, hypnotism, and a blog where I can publish my book to promote them.</p>
    <p>Recently, in 2021, I switched to Blogger for several reasons and I name my blog <a href = "https://writingnblogging.blogspot.com/" target = "blank" rel="dofollow">Writing and Blogging</a>: to be a writer, as a full-time job, has never been my dream. However, writing is one of my hobbies. The 2007 blog was not the first time I wrote something. I wrote things long before I knew the internet and blogs.</p>
    <p>When I was a college student, I liked to write articles that I read myself. Then I decided to write for the local media. Then I tried to write a book on literature; unfortunately, this book was rejected for publication due to its low quality. I even wrote a &quot;book&quot; and sold it to all kinds of people. A few years later, when I read that &quot;book&quot;, I burned them all; what a pity.</p>
    <p>Did I stop writing then? I did not do this. In 2008, I continued my studies in a place where the Internet works well. I didn&#x27;t continue writing because I didn&#x27;t have the idea of writing. Later, I received many writing assignments from teachers. These assignments gave me some ideas, and then I used WordPress to make my personal diary. I left my task there and exceeded my expectations, and I received thanks from blog readers. </p>
    <p>Today, I have written more than ten books on Amazon. I also wrote articles published in international scientific journals. However, he never mentioned that I was a writer. Perhaps it is because I believe in the different meanings of the author.</p>
    <h2>Who is the writer? </h2>
    <p>I mentioned the definition of writing, but I think it is not enough for us to understand its true meaning. To understand the word writer, one must understand a little bit more about the meaning of writing. Writing is one of language skills. There are four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. These language skills are further divided into two types of language skills, acceptance skills and production skills. These abilities can also be divided into two different types, natural abilities and unnatural abilities. Receptive skills include listening and reading skills, while production skills include speaking and writing skills.</p>
    <p>In another department, we can consider listening and speaking skills as natural language skills, and reading and writing skills as non-natural language skills. Productive language skills enable us to produce language, and receptive language skills enable us to accept language. At the same time, through natural language skills, I mean people are born to listen and speak, because we are born with two ears and one mouth (I guess they are people with no physical problems). Non-natural language skills tell us that we are not natural readers or writers, but we are all listeners and speakers. There is no need to receive formal training beforehand. As we grow, we can listen and understand what people are saying, and we can also learn how to speak.</p>
    <p>Unlike natural language skills, both reading and writing require some training. We need to learn the structure of the text to become readers and authors. So who is the writer? Usually, people interpret writers as jobs or occupations. This understanding leads others to believe that not everyone can (or should) be a writer. Look, maybe he is not a public speaker, or does not call himself a speaker, but he can definitely give a speech, can he? Therefore, a writer is not a person who is engaged in writing for the sake of making money. A writer is a person who has a certain ability to write.</p>
    <p>As humans, we tend to interact with others. To cater to this trend, we are equipped with languages. All the oral skills I mentioned earlier have one purpose: communication. Well, communication is not only about speaking, but also about listening; it&#x27;s not only about writing, but also about reading. What if you just want to talk but don&#x27;t want to listen? Of course, this is very bad communication. So basically writing is a way of communication. In addition, we communicated deliberately, but I will talk about it later.</p>
    <p>Everyone has the same opportunity to become a writer, a person with a certain amount of writing ability. If we think of writing as a profession, we will be left behind. Think of writing as a way of communication that transcends space and time.</p>
    <p>See, when I wrote this article, you were not reading this article. Maybe when you read this, he has passed away. This is the meaning of writing as a communication that transcends time and space. Will you write to me? Writing has its own rules, but texting your friends or commenting on this article is also a writing activity. So if you want to start becoming a writer, please write something nice in the comment section.</p>
    <p>To get started, try to write more than just a word or sentence; write a paragraph. It’s natural for people to write short, because they either have nothing to say or they may have something to say but don’t know how to say it. I can help you by asking you some questions to activate your &quot;creative button&quot;. Questions are good because they make us think.</p>
    <p>Have you read this article in its entirety? What new insights have you gained from this article? Do you find this article useful? Will you share this article with others so that they can benefit from it? Answer these questions in turn. </p>
    <p>Each question must be answered in a complete sentence. Write down your answer without changing the line. By answering these questions in the comment section, you have started to write your paragraph.</p>
