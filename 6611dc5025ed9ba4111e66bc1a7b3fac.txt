 <a href='https://ghostpedia.xyz'>Ghosts or supernatural</a> beings are not only in Indonesia, but throughout the world. However, only the name is different. Most of the appearances also differ according to the culture and beliefs that develop in that place. However, ghosts are still scary. One of the many ghosts that fall into the creepy category is pocong. This typical Indonesian ghost is often a figure that is feared by people.
<br>
His terrible face and the way he moves make anyone who sees him will run away. Besides all that, there are many other interesting facts about pocong that of course can make goosebumps goosebumps. Curious? Here's the review!</p>
  
  <h1 align='justify'>
  1. Pocong is the embodiment of spirits, not people who have died</h1>
<p align='justify'>
Many rumors say that the pocong comes from a corpse whose top rope is forgotten to be removed or wanders because it still has a grudge. However, the reality is that pocong is a supernatural being with such an embodiment. So, they are not corpses that used to exist in the world, but supernatural beings.</p>
<h2 align='justify'>
    2. Gentlemen type</h2>
<p align='justify'>
    Pocong is a ghost with brave characteristics. They are also known as gentleman ghosts, you know. Pocong will only reveal himself when someone is walking alone.
<br>
They will scare the person alone without the help of another pocong. However, if you meet a lot of people, this pocong turns into a shy type. They are even reluctant to show his figure considering the fame they have earned.</p>
<h2 align='justify'>
 <h2> 3. Smells bad and likes to spit</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
    He said the pocong had a very rancid smell and was similar to the smell of carrion. Even a few meters before you met, you already smelled it because of the smell.

<br>

However, if you don't feel like you smell something but instead meet them, it means you've been blown by them before, guys. So, I'm not aware. In addition, they are also the type who is quite tired of spitting at people</p>
<h2 align='justify'>
4. It's good to be in former unfortunate places</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
When a place has a terrible story or tragedy, the pocong will usually stay silent in that place. Whether it's the scene of an accident, suicide, or other tragedy.</p>
  <h2 align='justify'>
5. Often the figure of the seller of the place to eat</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
    If you've ever come to a place to eat that is incredibly crowded but the taste of the food is average, you need to be suspicious. Because rumors say that a place like that usually has been awaited by pocong.
<br>
Yep! There, Pocong is not a waiter, you know, but as a provider of income for the owner of the place. Usually, they are provided with a special place or room by the owner in which the place is not allowed to be entered by anyone.
    </p>
  <h2 align='justify'>
    
6. Stick to a quiet, humid, and dense place</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
    Besides often hanging out at places where the accident happened, pocong sightings also often appear in quiet, humid, and dense places, guys. Especially if the thickness is a thick banana tree. Most like them. But, why do they like being in places like that huh? Could it be because you're tired yourself so you can eat bananas when you're hungry, right?</p>
  <h2 align='justify'>7.Hobby is knocking house with head</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
    Small children sometimes like to have fun by knocking on people's doors and then just running away. However, their actions are still in the reasonable category because they are carried out in the afternoon or evening. Well, if someone knocks or even tends to bang on your door at night, that's just unnatural. Usually this is done by the original pocong who likes to bang on people's doors using his head.</p>
  <h2 align='justify'>
    8. The look in his eyes can make you stiff and helpless</h2>
  <p align='justify'>
    
    Rumor has it that if you meet a pocong, don't ever try to look him in the eye because it is said that when you look into his eyes, your body can instantly become stiff and helpless.
<br>
Whether it's because of the mystical ability of the pocong or the reaction of fear from people who see it, it's definitely not recommended to look directly into his eyes. Unless you look at him with black glasses.</p>
  <h2 align='justify'>
  9. You don't have to be brave to fight pocong</h2>
    <p align='justify'>
  Even though it seems easy to trick, you should never pretend to be brave to face it. Moreover, only armed with prayer. Even though you are Pak Haji's son, if your attitude is defiant and you underestimate God's creation, then bad things could happen to you. So, keep praying so you don't meet the appearance of pocong.
<br>
      <br>
Those are some interesting facts about the pocong as a supernatural creature typical of Indonesia. It's really scary this one pocong ghost. Especially if they had a duet with Aunt Kuntilanak, I can't imagine how terrible the horror that would be felt</p>
