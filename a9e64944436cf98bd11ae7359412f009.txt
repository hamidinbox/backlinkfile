In terms of environmental impacts, raised garden beds have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, raised garden beds can reduce the environmental impact of gardening by reducing water usage, preventing soil erosion, and promoting sustainable gardening practices such as composting and using organic fertilizers.

However, the construction of raised garden beds can have negative impacts if unsustainable materials are used or if they are built in areas where they disrupt natural ecosystems.
