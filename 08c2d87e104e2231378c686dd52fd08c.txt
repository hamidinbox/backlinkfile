Jin (Arabic: Janna) literally means something that connotes "hidden" or "invisible".
<br/>
According to Islamic teachings, jinn can see, but on the other hand humans cannot see them in the form of appearances
<br/>
  If there is a human who can see the jinn, then the jinn he sees are the jinn who are incarnated in the form of creatures that can be seen by ordinary human eyes.
<br/>
  The Jinn have genders like humans, namely, male and female, they are able to reproduce and reproduce and have lust.
<br/>
  <br/>
  As a Muslim woman, she must understand things like this, namely the treatment of women.
<br/>
Quoted from renunganislam.com, Maybe many women don't realize why Jin has sex with women or the term sleeps, even though it doesn't feel anything.
<br/>
Actually, that is not the understanding of Jin having sex with women.
<br/>

In fact, a woman is usually more vulnerable from Jin's attacks whether possessed or otherwise.
<br/>
This is because women are very weak for women who are not at all close to Allah SWT.
<br/>
  Rasulullah SAW said which means, "When women come out of their homes, the devil will adorn them front and back. Front on the front and back on the hips. Therefore, why is it said that women will bring slander when they leave their homes, it is recommended for them to wear closed clothes and pray and make remembrance so that the devil does not adorn them and does not harm them.‚Äù
<br/>
Jin is very happy to see the genitals, especially the genitalia of women. When the Prophet returned home from the cave of Hira.
<br/>
At that time Khatijah took off his clothes and asked the question whether the creature (jibril) still exists? If it's not there, it's an angel, if it's there, it's a demon.
<br/>
Because Jin really likes to see human genitalia. At that time the Prophet was in a state of fear at that time. And Jibril is gone.
<br/>
For women, they must read a prayer when opening their aurat when alone. At least Bismillah, Allah will give the hijab to the unseen world where no one can see it.
<br/>
When entering the bathroom, toilet during defecation or others, read a prayer and ask for protection from the cursed jinn. In a hadith it is also explained that one of the places for the jinn is in the toilet. Jin is very happy to be in the toilet.
<br/>
In addition to the WC, the genie is also very easy to enter the human body through the holes in the body. If you don't want Jin to enter, read a prayer to keep Jin away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Muslims, of course, we are forbidden to whistle because it is also the pleasure of the Jinn, and also when you yawn, cover your mouth so that the Jinn do not enter because it is already covered. And one more thing, don't travel with non-mahrams, among them there are Jin who follow.
<br/>
If for those of you who are already married, when you are going to pray, don't forget to read the prayer first, so that the genie does not participate when you and your partner have husband and wife relations.
<br/>
If you don't pray, it is very possible that the Jinn will come to you and your partner. Because Jin has lust and lust as well as humans.
<br/>
Regarding the Jin problem, there are several things you should avoid doing, such as the following:
  </p>
  <ul type='circle'>
    <li>
  Never bath in the open (do not wear a single thread)</li>
    <li>
Don't take a shower when it's close to sunset or after the evening.</li>
    <li>
Do not sleep naked or naked. For women, don't wear skimpy clothes</li>

<li>t's better to sleep on your side (following the sunnah of the Prophet), especially for women, don't sleep on your back</li>
<li>Don't sleep between Asr and Maghrib.
</li>
    <li>
  Don't sleep in the living room</li>
    <li>
For women when going to sleep, don't forget to read a prayer. This is so as not to be bullied by a male genie who will have sex with you.</li>
    </ul>
<p align='justify'>
If you feel squeezed or crushed, hasten to ask Allah SWT for help, maybe the Jinn is doing his crime.
<br/>
As women, of course everyone has a beautiful face, this is what makes the male genie attracted to women.
<br/>
For women who live in boarding houses, read prayers and protect themselves by reading the verse of the chair ba'da maghrib, dawn and before going to bed.
<br/>
This is done so that Jin is not in the middle of women's boarding houses. Also always pray to the Prophet Muhammad and read the Qur'an to add good auras.
<br/>
This applies not only to boarding house children, but to all women to be protected by Allah SWT from the cursed Jin and Satan.
<br/>
Friends, as there are many virtues taught in Islam, always pray, read the Qur'an, dhikr, pray and others so that they are protected from the influence of Jin and Satan.
