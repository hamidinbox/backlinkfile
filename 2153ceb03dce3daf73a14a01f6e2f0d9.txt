Apple Finally Puts 2014 11 Inch and 13 Inch MacBook Airs Into Obsolete Products
==============================
Apple officially includes the 11-inch and 13-inch MacBook Air products released in 2014 as Obsolete products. Thus, there will no longer be any hardware or software support for this product.

Obsolete products are products that are no longer supported by Apple. Apple also no longer makes spare parts for this product because it is 7 years old or more.

Users of Obsolete products are strongly advised to buy other newer products and still get support for hardware repairs and software updates.

Apple itself has now released the MacBook Air M1 at approximately the same price, which is $999. Equipped with a chip that is much faster and more efficient than the 2014 MacBook Air.
