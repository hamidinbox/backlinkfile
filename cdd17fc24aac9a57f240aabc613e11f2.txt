You can get a new phone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If laggy only appears when you are using a certain app, you should update, delete or reinstall it. If you drop your iPhone before or any other movement that may potentially cause your iPhone hardware damaged, And it appears to be slower than before, you might need technical repair. Go to support.apple.com to find help.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Software issue&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Software issue Except for hardware issues, there are a lot of things that could cause your iPhone to slow. For example, you might be running out of storage, your software version is outdated, your app malfunction, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">All of these could cause your iPhone to slow, now I’m going to show you four steps to improve it. All of the following operations are to speed up your iPhone.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">1. Clean up your storage.</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Go to the setting page, tap General and tap iPhone Storage, check this page, see what’s taking up your storage space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For me, I will delete Books, Podcasts, and so on, because I never use it before, also you can offload the app, it will delete the app but save the data. For other apps in the same way, at least save 2 gigabytes of storage for your iPhone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">2. Clear your Safari history and websites data.</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Go back to settings page, scroll down tap Safari and scroll down tap Clear History and Website Data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Be careful, this will remove your history, cookies, and other browsing data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3. Do some setting changes.</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">These settings will cause your iPhone to slow. Turn off some Background App Refresh, Go to settings page, scroll down tap General, and tap Background App Refresh. This function allows the certain app to download new content in the background when you’re not using your iPhone, So check for which app you don’t want to download new content in the background, I chose BOOKS, NOTES, PODCAST, you can choose whatever you like.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Then go back setting page, scroll down tap Mail, tap Accounts, and tap Fetch New Data,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Turn off Push, change the Fetch option to Manually or Hourly or Every 30 Minutes, it depends on you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Go back to the setting page again, scroll down tap Privacy, and tap Location Services,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Not every app needs to access your location all the time, you can change them to While Using the App.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now tap System Services, you can also turn off the option you don’t need, scroll down, make sure you turn off these three options.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Go back to the home screen, get in the app switcher, close up the app you are not using, some of the apps might taking too much performance in the background, And then go back to the home screen again, it got to be some widgets you don’t need, just delete it, too many widgets also will slow your iPhone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the above method is not working, please follow the next step.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">4. Check for an update or Reset your iPhone.</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">If your software version is too old, it may have some bugs that the developer already fixed and you don’t know, so update your software. Or you can reset your iPhone directly, you can go to settings page, tap General, scroll down tap reset and tap reset all settings, enter your password and it will reset your iPhone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But I recommend an easy tool that can reflash your iPhone and remove some cache, and also can repair some potential issues that you don’t know. It's call Reiboot. You can go to tenorshare.com click products and click here to Download Tenorshare ReiBoot.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When the download is complete, connect your iPhone to PC, open Reiboot, Click start, click Standard Repair, and click download, it will download the latest version of iOS firmware, When the download complete, click start standard</p><p style="text-align: justify;">repair, it will start to reflash and repair your iPhone, just wait for the process to complete, it will not cause any data loss.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">See, it’s easy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">These are all the things you can do to fix an iPhone or iPad if it has gotten slow.
